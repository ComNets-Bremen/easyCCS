<p>
Creating new lectures and aligning the contents to the students
and their knowledge can be a challenging work for all levels of
education: Knowledge dependencies between the different blocks
of lectures are not always visible. The problem increases if content
from third parties like colleagues or from the Internet is being
used. The content curation tool described in this poster aims on
this challenge and offers a way of automatic, skill-based lecture
creation and dependency management. The objective is that the
lecturer can enter the required skills as well as the type of teaching
materials and the system will generate a complete course from
available contents.

<i>easyCCS</i> - the easy content curation system aims on this challenge and allows an easy management of lecturing content. Stay tuned for additional information!
